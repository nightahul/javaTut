Java uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to databases. JDBC allows you to connect to a wide-range of databases (Oracle, MySQL, etc),
 but we're going to use the in-built database called Java DB, a version of Apache Derby.
 
 Create a database in Services.
 Connect to it
 Add tables/data
 Disconnect from it
